        <h3>Summary</h3> 
            <p>I have a background in data science but my true skillset lies in getting sh*t done building relationships and building relationships. I began my career as a data scientist where I built models/algorithms for loan providers using behavioral data instead of traditional variables (such as credit scores). I then joined IBM as a data scientist but was quickly promoted to project/product/program manager, chief of staff, and managing consultant. My technical foundation allows me to effectively communicate with engineers as I focus on what I am best at -- being operational. I just moved to the Bay Area and am seeking an individual to work on problems that can make a real difference to peoples lives. If you are looking to be a technical co-founder in the Bay Area reach out and let's grab a cup of coffee/boba!</p>
